# FallingSquares

Simple game with UI. Rules are as follows, player has to click on the squares that are falling from the top of the screen to the bottom. 
Points are granted in form of squares clicked (destroyed) divided by the number of squares generated in total. Score is displayed in the real time on the screen while playing.

Improvement:

Devide code into more readable pieces. 
Application's window is not flexible.
There is no documentation or comments of some kind.
